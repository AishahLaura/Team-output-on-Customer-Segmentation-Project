# Team-output-on-Customer-Segmentation-Project
Outputting Canada in the country feature in the online retail segmentation data.
Getting into the country feature to output Canada with the every transaction executed.
The first ten outputs from the transaction made from canada were made in the same month, on the same day and during the same time from the same customer. So it means one customer could make multiple purchases at a go.
The transactions from Canada has 150 entries (rows) with ten transactions in March, just a transaction in May, about nine transactions in June, about 15 transactions in July and about 5 transactions in August.
